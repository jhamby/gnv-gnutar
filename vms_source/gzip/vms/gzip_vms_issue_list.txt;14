1. Running vms_prebuild always updates config.status
   only should create if non-existant as that may be causing make to re-run
configure for rebuilds.

2. Needs version report fixed.
Done.

3. Special options for linking with threads?
  /threads_enable if missing -pthread option in ld command.
Looks done.

4. make check ?
Ticket filed.
Make check seems to be failing due to Bash redirection issues.
The zdiff command/script also seems to have those same issues.

  GEN      check-local
./zdiff: line 81: 4: bad file number
diff: -: illegal seek
./zdiff: line 160: test: : integer expression expected


make check does a:
  gzip --help
  gzip --help
  gzip --help
  gzip --help

  GEN      gzip.doc.gz

  GEN      check-local
  gzip (no arguments)  Exits success

  gzip -cd -- gzip.doc.gz  Exits success

diff: /dev/fd/5: no such file or directory
/usr/bin/zdiff: line 110: cannot duplicate fd 3 to fd 0: bad file number
/usr/bin/zdiff: line 110: cannot duplicate fd 4 to fd 1: bad file number

  ***[check] error 2


bash-4.3$ zdiff gzip.doc.gz
diff: -: illegal seek.




5. needs to work with gzip logical name for env options.

6. VMS specific extensions?

7. Needs to work with tar

ncompress missing compress alias!!!

8. libgzip.so seems to only be supplied by gnome-vfs?

9. gzip configure runs gzip if found at least three times.
(just a note)
